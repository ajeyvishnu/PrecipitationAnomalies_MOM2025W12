# Precipitation Anomalies Dashboard

This Tableau project visualizes global precipitation anomalies from 1940 to 2024, comparing each country's data to world averages. It features interactive elements to explore country-specific insights and global trends.

## Features

- **World Tile Map**: Each country's tile contains a line chart of precipitation anomalies over the years.
- **Color Coding**: Tiles are color-coded to indicate whether 2024 precipitation is greater or less than 1940.
- **Interactive Country View**: Clicking on a country displays a detailed view:
  - **Country vs. World Bar Chart**: Shows precipitation anomalies by year for the selected country.
  - **World Gantt Chart Overlay**: Displays world averages overlapped with country data, color-coded by whether the country exceeded or fell below world averages each year.
